# Superstore-Tableau-Dashboards

## Problem Statement
A moderate-sized superstore based in the United States is currently facing a significant problem in trying to increase revenue and profits over the medium to long-term and has decided to focus more on the top few product categories nationwide with strong emphasis on specific product categories that are most popular in each region of the United States and which US States bring in the most revenue and profits for the business to guide expansion plans. To achieve its objectives, the superstore wants dashboards illustrating the information above required for them to make inventory and operations decisions that will materially impact the business. The superstore intends to use the information to improve same-store sales to please shareholders before embarking on further expansion.

### Steps followed 

- Step 1: Load data into Tableau Desktop, moderate-sized dataset is a excel xlsx file.
- Step 2: Perform data cleaning & validation if required on the data source tab of Tableau Desktop.
- Step 3: Creation of two visualization dashboards optimised for desktop view for diagnostic analytics purposes.
